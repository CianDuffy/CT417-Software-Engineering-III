# CT417-Software-Engineering-III
Assignments completed as part of the module CT417: Software Engineering III (academic year 2016/2017) 

The directory Assignment 1 - Student Registration System contains (intuitively) the first assignment completed as part of the module. The goal of this assignment was for us to familiarise ourselves with industry standard version control, continuous integration and build management tools (in this case git, Shippable and Maven respectively).
